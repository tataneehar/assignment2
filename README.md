# Assignment 2 – Control Structures in Python

This repository contains Python programs developed for **Assignment 2 (Module 3)**.  
The objective of this assignment is to understand and apply **control structures** such as conditional statements and loops in Python.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description
This program determines whether a given integer is **even** or **odd** using an `if-else` statement.

### Functionality
- Accepts an **integer input** from the user.
- Uses the **modulus operator (`%`)** to check divisibility by 2.
- Displays whether the number is even or odd.

### Sample Output
Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number

### Concepts Used
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Modulus operator (`%`)
- User input and output

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description
This program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.

### Functionality
- Initializes a variable to store the sum.
- Iterates through numbers from **1 to 50** using a `for` loop.
- Adds each number to the total.
- Displays the final sum.

### Sample Output
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

### Concepts Used
- `for` loop
- Accumulator variable
- Arithmetic operations
